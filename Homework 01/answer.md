1. a. 8 mod 7 = 1
   b. 15 mod 7 = 1
   c. 3^(7-2) mod 7 = 3^5 mod 7 = 243 mod 7 = 5
2. Closure, Associativity, Identity element and Inverse element properties are satisfied.
3. 13 mod 5 = 3
4. x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12 = (x - 2)(x^2 - x + 6) . Therefore, the positive root is +2. Degree of the polynomial is 3.

Use cases:
I havent used zero knowledge proofs in any system.
Even though I personally have not seen the usage of it, zero knowledge proofs can be used in authentication systems, for verifying the integrity of a voting system and to protect the privacy of people.
Most important feature of ZKP is that it preserves the privacy and also the fact that it allows trust to be established without requiring a trusted third party.
