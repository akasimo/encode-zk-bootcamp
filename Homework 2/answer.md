# Homework 2

1. a. True
   b. False. They are either 2 or 0
2. Done, could not find a vanity address with "aaa"
3. Big O notation shows how much the performance of an algorithm changes as the input size changes.
   a. O(n) means as input size grows linearly complexity of computation grows linearly as well.
   b. O(1) means performance of the algorithm does not change as input size grows. They are independent.
   c. O(log n) means increase in inptu size has a logarithmic effect on the complexity of the algorithm. Marginal increases in input has diminshing impact as input size grows.
For a proof size, we would like to have as low complexity as possible. O(1) is the best, O(n) is the worst among these.
