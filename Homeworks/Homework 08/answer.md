# Homework 8

1. Confidential tokens is needed, in order to be procted from the eyes of the big brother. In the long run, public nature of the blockchains will be a tool of the centralized governments instead of a decentralized force. Privacy is needed to prevent government control.
2. I have done private transactions in Zcash, but Zcash platform is quite limited therefore not that useful. I would be willing to use platforms such as Aztec for further privacy, however I also would like to take my time for platforms to mature in order to not to face a bug similar to the one Zcash experienced.
3. Individual groups and institutions can not develop these services, the almighty government stamps down on them, dissuade them from developing. This fact also disincentivizes upcoming developers to work on these topics. I believe the solution to this problem will be the anonymous developers and open source culture in order to be able to evade and shift the blame when the authority points the finger at them. Additionally, regulatory arbitrage will play a major role in this aspect in the upcoming multi-polar world order as different authorities will have different priorities. At the end, for humanity allowed list of things that can be developed will be the union of A & B authorities, not the intersection.
